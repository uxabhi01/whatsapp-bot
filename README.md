+
+An automation bot that receives WhatsApp messages through Twilio, collects lead details, qualifies the lead with Groq AI, stores the result in Google Sheets, and notifies the business owner when a lead looks promising.
+
+![WhatsApp Lead Qualifier Bot Flow](assets/whatsapp-bot-flow.svg)
+
+## What It Does
+
+- Receives incoming WhatsApp messages from Twilio.
+- Guides the customer through a simple lead qualification conversation.
+- Collects name, requirement, budget, timeline, and the original message.
+- Uses Groq AI to clean the lead data and score it from 1 to 10.
+- Saves qualified lead details to Google Sheets.
+- Sends a WhatsApp alert to the owner when the lead score is high.
+
+## Tech Stack
+
+- **Express.js** - Webhook server for Twilio messages.
+- **Trigger.dev** - Background task runner for lead processing.
+- **Groq SDK** - AI-based lead cleanup and scoring.
+- **Twilio** - WhatsApp messaging and owner alerts.
+- **Google Sheets API** - Lead storage and lightweight CRM.
+- **TypeScript** - Main project language.

+
+## Basic Setup
+
+The original plain-text setup guide is available in [`readme.txt`](readme.txt). This README is the presentable GitHub version of that same guide.
+
+### 1. Install Dependencies
+
+```bash
+npm install
+```
+
+### 2. Configure Environment Variables
+
+Create a local `.env` file using the variable names from [`.env.example`](.env.example), then fill in your own credentials.
+
+Required for AI scoring:
+
+```env
+GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
+```
+
+Required for Trigger.dev:
+
+```env
+TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID=your_trigger_project_id
+TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=your_trigger_secret_key
+```
+
+Optional for Google Sheets logging:
+
+```env
+GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your_google_service_account_email
+GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_google_private_key_with_escaped_newlines"
+GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
+```
+
+Optional for WhatsApp owner alerts:
+
+```env
+TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
+TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
+TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
+DEFAULT_OWNER_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+1234567890
+```
+
+### 3. Start the Webhook Server
+
+```bash
+npx tsx server.ts
+```
+
+By default, the webhook server runs on:
+
+```text
+http://localhost:3000
+```
+
+### 4. Expose the Local Server
+
+Use ngrok or a similar tunneling tool:
+
+```bash
+ngrok http 3000
+```
+
+Copy the generated HTTPS URL and add the webhook path:
+
+```text
+https://your-ngrok-url/webhook/twilio
+```
+
+Set that URL as your Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox webhook.
+
+### 5. Start Trigger.dev
+
+In another terminal:
+
+```bash
+npx trigger.dev@latest dev
+```
+
+### 6. Test the Bot
+
+Send a WhatsApp message to your Twilio Sandbox number, for example:
+
+```text
+Hi, I need a website for my business. My budget is $5000 and I need it in 2 months.
+```
+
+The bot will collect missing details, qualify the lead, save it to Google Sheets if configured, and notify the owner when the score is high enough.
+
+## Environment Safety
+
+Real credentials should stay only in your local `.env` file. The repository includes `.gitignore` rules so `.env`, logs, local Trigger.dev files, and `node_modules` are not uploaded to GitHub.
+
+## Notes
+
+- Use `reset`, `restart`, or `start over` in WhatsApp to clear a conversation.
+- If Google Sheets credentials are missing, the bot falls back to in-memory conversation state.
+- If Twilio owner alert credentials are missing, lead qualification still runs, but owner notification is skipped.
